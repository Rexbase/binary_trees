## Project Description

The goal of this project is to design a web infrastructure that can host a web application. This infrastructure should be scalable, reliable, and secure, ensuring high availability and performance for end-users.

## Infrastructure Design

![Web Infrastructure Diagram](link-to-diagram-image)

Provide a high-level diagram of the web infrastructure design. This can include components like load balancers, web servers, application servers, databases, and any other relevant elements. Include explanations and the purpose of each component.

## Technologies

- List the technologies and tools used in the infrastructure design.

## Security Considerations

- Describe the security measures in place, such as firewalls, encryption, and access controls.

## Scalability and Redundancy

- Explain how the infrastructure is designed for scalability and redundancy to handle increased traffic and ensure reliability.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Describe the monitoring and logging tools and strategies used to track the health and performance of the infrastructure.
